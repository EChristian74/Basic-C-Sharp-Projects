PROJECT DETAILS

DAILY REPORT SUBMISSION ASSIGNMENT:
* The program must start by printing “The Tech Academy.”
* The next line must be “Student Daily Report.”

* The DR must contain the following questions:
  - What is your name?
  - What course are you on?
  - What page number?
  - Do you need help with anything? Please answer “true” or “false.”
  - Were there any positive experiences you’d like to share? Please give specifics.
  - Is there any other feedback you’d like to provide? Please be specific.
  - How many hours did you study today?
* After all of the questions are asked, print, “Thank you for your answers. An Instructor will respond to this shortly. Have a great day!” This is the end of the program.
* Add comments to each line or block of your code to explain what it does exactly, so that another developer could read and understand your code.

MATH AND COMPARISON OPERATOR SUBMISSION ASSIGNMENT:
* Your job is to create an anonymous income comparison program.
* The program must start by printing “Anonymous Income Comparison Program” to the screen.
* It must then print “Person 1” to the screen and get the following details from user input:
  - Hourly Rate
  - Hours worked per week
* It must then print “Person 2” to the screen and then get the following details from user input:
  - Hourly rate
  - Hours worked per week
* It must then print to the screen “Annual salary of Person 1:” and display the exact salary below it.
* It must then print to the screen “Annual salary of Person 2:” and display the exact salary below it.
* It must then print to the screen “Does Person 1 make more money than Person 2?” and write the true or false value of this statement below it.
* Add comments to each line or block of your code to explain what it does exactly, so that another developer could read and understand your code.

BOOLEAN LOGIC SUBMISSION ASSIGNMENT:
* Create a basic approval program for car insurance. It will ask the applicant some questions and return a “true” or “false” at the end to determine whether   or not the applicant qualified for car insurance.
* Your application must ask these questions:
  - What is your age?
  - Have you ever had a DUI?
  - How many speeding tickets do you have?

* Use the following qualification rules to determine if the applicant qualifies for car insurance:
  - Applicants must be over 15 years old.
  - Applicants must not have any DUI’s.
  - Applicants must not have more than 3 speeding tickets.

* Print the result of the boolean expression created from the above business rules.  

  Example output:
  What is your age?
  32
  Have you ever had a DUI?
  false
  How many speeding tickets do you have?
  1
  Qualified?
  true

* Add comments to each line or block of your code to explain what it does exactly, so that another developer could read and understand your code.

BRANCHING SUBMISSION ASSIGNMENT
* Your job is to create a console-based application for getting a shipping quote for a package.
* The first line of the program must be: “Welcome to Package Express. Please follow the instructions below.”
  - The user must then be prompted for the package weight.
* If the weight is greater than 50, display the error message, “Package too heavy to be shipped via Package       Express. Have a good day.” At this point the program would end.
  - The user must then be prompted for the package width.
  - Then the package height.
  - Then the package length.
* If the dimensions total greater than 50, display the error message, “Package too big to be shipped via          Package Express.” At this point the program would end.
  - Next, multiply the three dimensions (height, width, & length) together, and multiply the product by the         weight. Finally, divide the outcome by 100.
  - The result of that calculation is the quote.
  - Display the quote to the user as a dollar amount.
* Add comments to each line or block of your code to explain what it does exactly, so that another developer could read and understand your code.
* Submitted 10/22/2021


CONSOLE APP SUBMISSION ASSIGNMENT:
* Create a console app that does/includes the following:
  - Do a boolean comparison using a while statement.
  - Do a boolean comparison using a do while statement.
  - Add comments to each line or block of your code to explain what it does exactly, so that another developer could read     and understand your code.
