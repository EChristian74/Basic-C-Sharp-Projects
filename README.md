* It must then print “Person 1” to the screen and get the following details from user input:
  - Hourly Rate
  - Hours worked per week
* It must then print “Person 2” to the screen and then get the following details from user input:
  - Hourly rate

* It must then print to the screen “Annual salary of Person 1:” and display the exact salary below it.
* It must then print to the screen “Annual salary of Person 2:” and display the exact salary below it.
* It must then print to the screen “Does Person 1 make more money than Person 2?” and write the true or false value of this statement below it.
* Add comments to each line or block of your code to explain what it does exactly, so that another developer could read and understand your code.
* Submitted 10/17/2021


BOOLEAN LOGIC SUBMISSION ASSIGNMENT:
* Create a basic approval program for car insurance. It will ask the applicant some questions and return a “true” or “false” at the end to determine whether   or not the applicant qualified for car insurance.
* Your application must ask these questions:
  - What is your age?
  - Have you ever had a DUI?
  - How many speeding tickets do you have?

* Use the following qualification rules to determine if the applicant qualifies for car insurance:
  - Applicants must be over 15 years old.
  - Applicants must not have any DUI’s.
  - Applicants must not have more than 3 speeding tickets.

* Print the result of the boolean expression created from the above business rules.  

  Example output:
  What is your age?
  32
  Have you ever had a DUI?
  false
  How many speeding tickets do you have?
  1
  Qualified?
  true

* Add comments to each line or block of your code to explain what it does exactly, so that another developer could read and understand your code.
* Submitted 10/18/2021


BRANCHING SUBMISSION ASSIGNMENT:
* Your job is to create a console-based application for getting a shipping quote for a package.
* The first line of the program must be: “Welcome to Package Express. Please follow the instructions below.”
  - The user must then be prompted for the package weight.
* If the weight is greater than 50, display the error message, “Package too heavy to be shipped via Package       Express. Have a good day.” At this point the program would end.
  - The user must then be prompted for the package width.
  - Then the package height.
  - Then the package length.
* If the dimensions total greater than 50, display the error message, “Package too big to be shipped via          Package Express.” At this point the program would end.
  - Next, multiply the three dimensions (height, width, & length) together, and multiply the product by the         weight. Finally, divide the outcome by 100.
  - The result of that calculation is the quote.
  - Display the quote to the user as a dollar amount.
* Add comments to each line or block of your code to explain what it does exactly, so that another developer could read and understand your code.
* Submitted 10/22/2021

* Add comments to each line or block of your code to explain what it does exactly, so that another developer could    read and understand your code. 
* Submitted 10/24/2021


CONSOLE APP SUBMISSION ASSIGNMENT 1-6:

* Create a console app that does/contains the following:
  - A one-dimensional array of strings.
  - Ask the user to input some text.
  - A loop that iterates through each string in the array and adds the user's text input to the end of each string. This step will not output anything to the console, but will     update each array element by appending the user's text.
  - Then create a loop that prints off each string in the array on a separate line.

* An infinite loop.
  - Save your code.
  - Fix the infinite loop so that it will execute properly.

* Add the following to your console app and perform these actions:
  - A loop where the comparison that’s used to determine whether to continue iterating the loop is a “<” operator.
  - Save and execute your code.
  - A loop where the comparison that’s used to determine whether to continue iterating the loop is a “<=” operator.

* Add the following to your console app and perform these actions:
  - A list of strings where each item in the list is unique.
  - Ask the user to input text to search for in the list.
  - A loop that iterates through the list and then displays the index of the list that contains matching text on the screen.
  - Add code to the loop to check if the user put in text that isn't on the list and, if they did, tells the user their input is not on the list.
  - Add code to the loop that stops it from executing once a match has been found.

* Add the following to your console app and perform these actions:
  - A list of strings that has at least two identical strings in the list. Ask the user to select text to search for in the list.
  - Create a loop that iterates through the list and then displays the indices of the items matching the user-selected text.
  - Add code to the loop to check if the user put in text that isn't on the list and, if they did, tells the user their input is not on the list.

* Add the following to your console app and perform these actions:
  - Create a list of strings that has at least two identical strings in the list.
  - Create a foreach loop that evaluates each item in the list, and displays a message showing the string and whether or not it has already appeared in the list.
  - Save and execute your code.
* Add comments to each line or block of your code to explain what it does exactly, so that another developer could read and understand your code.
* Submitted 10/29/2021


CONSOLE APP STRINGS AND INTEGERS SUBMISSION ASSIGNMENT:

* Create a list of integers. Ask the user for a number to divide each number in the list by. Write a loop that takes each integer in the list, divides it by the number the user entered, and displays the result to the screen.

- Run the code, entering in non-zero numbers as the user. Look at the displayed results.
- Run the code again, entering in zero as the number to divide by. Note any error messages you get.
- Run the code once again, entering in a string as the number to divide by. Note any error messages you get.
- Now put the loop in a try/catch block. Below and outside of the try/catch block, make the program print a message to the display to let you know the program has emerged from the try/catch block and continued on with program execution. In the catch block, display the error message to the screen. Then try various combinations of user input: valid numbers, zero and a string. Ensure the proper error messages display on the screen, and that the code after the try/catch block gets executed.
- Add comments to each line or block of your code to explain what it does exactly, so that another developer could read and understand your code.
- Submitted 10/30/2021


MAIN METHOD SUBMISSION ASSIGNMENT:

- Create a class. In that class, create a method that will take in an integer, create a math operation for this integer (addition, subtraction, etc.), then return the answer as an integer
- In the Main() method of the console app, instantiate the class and call the one method, passing in an integer. Display the result to the screen.
- Add a second method to the class with the same name that will take in a decimal, create a different math operation for it, then return the answer as an integer.
- In the Main() method of the console app, instantiate the class and call the second method, passing in a decimal. Display the result to the screen.
- Add a third method to the class, with the same name, that will take in a string, convert it to an integer if possible, do a different math operation to it, then return the answer as an integer.
- In the Main() method of the console app, instantiate the class and call the third method, passing in a string that equates to an integer. Display the result to the screen.
- Add comments to each line or block of your code to explain what it does exactly, so that another developer could read and understand your code.
- Submitted 11/2/2021
